# tl;dr Syllabus

## Goal

Above all, the goal of CS50 AP is to empower you to become informed consumers and producers of technology through the lens of programming.

## Location and Time

CS50 AP will meet four days a week in the Amon-Meyer Science Center in **Room S-2** (lower level) during **B block** and in **Room S-5** (lower level) during **F block**.

## Relationship between CS50 AP and College Board

CS50 AP is a College Board endorsed curriculum for AP Computer Science Principles (CSP). AP CSP requires the sufficient completion of two performance tasks and an exam to receive college credit for the course.

The AP score for College Board is based on two performance tasks, the Explore Task and the Create Task, that make up the AP Digital Portfolio and an multiple-choice AP Exam. More information on the structure of AP CSP can be found at [AP Central](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/exam).

## Grades

A quick note on grades as taken from Harvard's CS50 syllabus:
>  "Know that CS50 draws quite the spectrum of students, including 'those less comfortable,' 'those more comfortable,' and those somewhere in between. However, what ultimately matters in this course is not so much where you end up relative to your classmates but where you, (at the end of the course), end up relative to yourself in Week 0... Those less comfortable and somewhere in between are not at a disadvantage vis-à-vis those more comfortable."

### Problem Grading Scheme

#### Three Axes

Problems in CS50 AP are graded along the following three axes:

* **Correctness:** the extent to which code is consistent with specifications and free of bugs.
* **Design:** the extent to which code is written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)
* **Style:** the extent to which code is readable (i.e., commented and intended with variables aptly named)

#### Five Point Scale

When grading for the 3 axes, CS50 AP uses a five point grading scale for determining marks as follows:

| Level | Description                                |
|-------|--------------------------------------------|
| **5** | Best: Essentially no room for improvement. |
| **4** | Better: Minor room for improvement.        |
| **3** | Good: Some room for improvement.           |
| **2** | Fair: Ample room for improvement.          |
| **1** | Poor                                       |
| **0** | No Effort                                  |

NOTE: A grade of 3 is indeed good! Understandably so, this can take some time to become comfortable with.

<!--
#### Grade Calculation Formula

Each problem will be assigned a grade out of 30 points using the following formula:

`3 * Correctness + 2 * Design + Style`
-->

## Required Materials

- Laptop
- Notebook

## Classroom Environment

We will collectively determine appropriate community norms in class.

## Academic Honesty
The academic honesty policy of CS50 AP mirrors that of Harvard's.  It can be summed up as "be reasonable."
- You may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you.
- Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code to others, but you may not view theirs.
