# tl;dr Syllabus

## Goal

Above all, the goal of compsci.one is to empower you to become informed consumers and producers of technology.

## Location and Time

compsci.one will meet four days a week in the Amon-Meyer Science Center in Room S-5 (lower level) during E block.

## Grades

Grades in compsci.one are not determined by where you end up at the conclusion of the semester relative to your classmates. Rather, grades reflect your cumulative growth relative to yourself in week 0.

### Weighting

|Section|Weighting|
|--|--|
|Programming Problems|40%|
|Tests|20%|
|Quizzes|15%|
|Final Project|15%|
|Written Assignments|10%|

### Problem Grading Scheme

#### Three Axes

Problems in compsci.one are graded along the following three axes:

* **Correctness:** the extent to which code is consistent with specifications and free of bugs.
* **Design:** the extent to which code is written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)
* **Style:** the extent to which code is readable (i.e., commented and intended with variables aptly named)

#### Five Point Scale

When grading for the 3 axes, compsci.one uses a five point grading scale for determining marks as follows:

| Level | Description                                |
|-------|--------------------------------------------|
| **5** | Best: Essentially no room for improvement. |
| **4** | Better: Minor room for improvement.        |
| **3** | Good: Some room for improvement.           |
| **2** | Fair: Ample room for improvement.          |
| **1** | Poor                                       |
| **0** | No Effort                                  |

<!--
#### Grade Calculation Formula

Each problem will be assigned a grade out of 30 points using the following formula:

`3 * Correctness + 2 * Design + Style`
-->

## Required Materials

- Laptop
- Notebook

## Classroom Environment

We will collectively determine appropriate community norms in class.

## Academic Honesty
The academic honesty policy of compsci.one mirrors that of Harvard's introduction to CS course, CS50.  It can be summed up as "be reasonable."
- You may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you.
- Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code to others, but you may not view theirs.

For detailed information about the course's academic honesty policy, see the following:
