## Directions and Submission

Respond to the following thought questions in a file called **interwebs.txt**.

To submit run `submit50 cs50ap/interwebs@spencertiberi/checks`.

### 0. Mom! The internet's down!

Given the many different components that comprise an internet connection, how do we ensure all of them work together properly? If you do disconnect, what are the places you should look to find the problem?

### 1. Shoot him! He's the fake one!

Can you think of potential problems if two devices were to have the same IP address on a network? For some info on this question, check out this [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_spoofing).

### 2. Dead Hot Chili Peppers?

What is DHCP and why do we need it?

### 3. New phone. Who dis?

What is DNS? Why do we need (or rather, why is it nice to have) DNS?

### 4. The scenic route.

Why do you think data will seemingly travel farther away than is necessary only to return back to a desired location (i.e. going from Seattle to Los Angeles and then back up to Palo Alto)?

### 5. How do I make sure I get my memes?

How do TCP and IP work together to ensure efficient and reliable packet delivery across the Internet?
