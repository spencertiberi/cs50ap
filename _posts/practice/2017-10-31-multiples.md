# Multiples

## Concepts

For Loops and Conditions

## Problem
Take as input a number between 1 and 100. Use a for loop to print every multiple of that number between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

```bash
~/workspace/ $ ./multiples
Give me a number between 1 and 100: 5
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100
```
